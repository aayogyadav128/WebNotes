# WebNotes
A Notes Storing Application build with React.

Hey there, I recently completed a course from udemy "Web Development BootCamp" by Angela yu (https://appbrewery.com/)
and it was an amazing course.
I developed lot of projects while learning and this is one of them.

This is a simple but stylish Notes keeping Application that runs on browser.

Steps to run this.
1. Make a new folder and clone this repository in that folder.
2. Open that folder inside terminal.
3. Run "$npm install".
4. Run "$npm start".

The WebNotes will Automatically open in your browser.
